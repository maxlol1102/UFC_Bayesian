A machine learning model that predicts fight outcomes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) using historical fight data and fighter statistics.

UFC Fight Outcome Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting fight outcomes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical fight data and fighter statistics to build a predictive model that estimates the probability of a fighter winning a match.

📌 Project Overview

Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fights are influenced by many variables such as fighter experience, striking accuracy, grappling performance, physical attributes, and past performance trends. This project uses data-driven techniques to:

Collect and preprocess historical UFC fight data

Engineer meaningful features from fighter statistics

Train and evaluate machine learning models

Predict fight winners based on pre-fight metrics
