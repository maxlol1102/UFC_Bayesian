# UFC_Bayesian
A machine learning model that predicts fight outcomes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) using historical fight data and fighter statistics.

## UFC Fight Outcome Prediction Model

This project builds a machine learning model to predict fight outcomes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).

By leveraging historical fight data and detailed fighter statistics, the model estimates the probability of a fighter winning a matchup before the fight takes place.

## Project Overview

Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a complex and dynamic sport where outcomes depend on multiple factors — including striking efficiency, grappling ability, physical attributes, experience level, and recent performance trends.

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in historical UFC data and translate them into predictive insights.

## The project pipeline includes:

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
Cleaning historical UFC fight data and preparing it for modeling.

### Feature Engineering
- Creating meaningful features such as:

- Win/loss ratios

- Striking and takedown differentials

- Reach, height, and age differences

- Recent performance indicators

### Model Training & Evaluation
Training machine learning models to classify fight outcomes and evaluating them using appropriate performance metrics.

### Outcome Prediction
Generating probability-based predictions for fight winners using pre-fight statistics.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how statistical modeling and machine learning can be applied to sports analytics — specifically in predicting outcomes in professional MMA competitions.
